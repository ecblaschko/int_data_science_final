# int_data_science_final

For our final project in intermediate data science, we were asked to train 3 supervised learning models on a large dataset containing credit card payment information. The goal was to predict whether a customer would default on their credit card payments. The dataset required extensive data cleaning and dimensionality reduction. I chose a logistic regression, random forest, and GBM to analyze this data. 

The dataset is from a business so I am unable to upload the raw dataset, but I've included the html file of the project.
