# int_data_science_final

For our final project in intermediate data science, we were asked to train 3 supervised learning models on a large dataset containing credit card payment information. The goal was to predict whether a customer would default on their credit card payments. The dataset required extensive data cleaning, scaling, and preprocessing. We chose a logistic regression, random forest classifier, and a gradient boosting machine to analyze this data. We also iterated over different parameters to tune the models. The project also included writing a report that one would give to a manager after analyzing this dataset.

The dataset is from a business so I am unable to upload the raw dataset, but I've included the html file of the project and the writeup.
